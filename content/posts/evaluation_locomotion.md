In this post I will evaluate my locomotion technique.

The fact that we have fixed boxes significantly reduces the cybersickness, as it is giving a fixed point. Furthermore moving with the body at all, the head also moves forward. This also reduces cybersickness, as the conflict between the seen and the feeled picture reduces.
