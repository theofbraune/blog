If you want to create your own website or webblog, you are often faced with a ton of possible frameworks. Here in this post, I'll explain how you can easily setup your webblog with the static page generator [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).<br>

To get started, you first need to install the Hugo framework. I used on Ubuntu the Snap store for it.

{{< figure src="/images/setup_blog/snap_store.png"   width="50%" height="50%" >}}

In the next step I created a new directory, where I created all the necessary files. In order to create a new hugo blog, you can cd into the desired directory and then call
```sh
$ hugo new site <your sitename>
```

In the picture you can see, that the creation with the hugo new call creates directely a certain number of folders and files for you.

If you want to add some content to your blog, you can call
```sh
$ hugo new posts/<title of your post>.md
```
This will create a markdown file with your chosen title. You will see a header, that is structured like 

 
```

title= "Setting up a Webblog with Hugo"
date= 2021-12-21T11:31:19+01:00
draft= false
author = "Your Name"
tags = []
+++
```

Note that by default `draft` is set to `true`. This will prevent, that you cannot show it in your final blog.
You can update the default settings for this header in the `config.toml` file. For further information how this can be done, I'll refer to the [official Hugo documentary](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/).
It is useful to add tags, because later on you can show all posts, that share a tag together at once.

So, you are now able to create new content to your blog, but if you call 
```sh
$ hugo server
```
and launch your localhost, you'll realize, that you have no styling at all and that it looks really boring. Now you have two options (or certainly there are more and I just don't know about them). You can either choose a [theme on the official hugo website](https://themes.gohugo.io/) and unpack this in the themes folder of your hugo project. You will find a lot of sample themes and I'm sure you will find one that you like. In this case you do not need to touch any css or javascript at all.

Nevertheless I decided to design and play with [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), css, javascript and html on my own.
In this blog with hugo I want to create content in the form of markdown files, which will then be in a nice looking websetup. In order to have for example the same header with navbar for all blog posts, we need to define a base website and then use some hugo code. The code shown below is an example of how this could be achieved. There is some base html with bootstrap. In order to convert the content in markdown into renderable html we make use of the hugo scipting language 
{{< figure src="/images/setup_blog/base_html.png"   width="80%" height="80%" >}}

Here we fetch the title of the site and put it in the header of the website. Note that the name of the website is strict. This side, that builds the skeleton for the content, must be named `baseof.html`. 
The hierarchy of the sites is strict! The rules of how to name the sites can be found [here](https://gohugo.io/templates/base/). 
In order to put the content from each site into the website, we see in the picture above ``{{ block "main" .}}{{end}} ``; we need to define the `"main"` in a file called `single.html`. 

{{< figure src="/images/setup_blog/single_post.png"   width="50%" height="50%" >}}

Note that the syntax starts with `{{define "main"}}` and ends with `{{end}}`. The part inbetween has the html article structure and uses the hugo script calls to fetch the title, the date, the tags and the content of the corresponding markdown file.

This allows you to define a single page with navbar and content. But of course we want to have an overview page for all the blog posts as well. To achieve this, we modify the `list.html`. Note that with the hierarchy, the `list.html` will be embedded into the skeleton defined above. I call a hugo method with the `{{ range .Paginator.Pages}}`, this allows to loop over all posts and to display them in the listing page.

{{< figure src="/images/setup_blog/list-item.png"   width="50%" height="50%" >}}

We can fetch the information about the author, the date and the summary in order and display them, seen as above.

Lastly, we want to have a good looking landing page. All the .html files before need to be saven in the folder `layouts/_default`, the landing page only needs to be saven in the folder `layouts` and needs to be called `index.html`. So, have fun to choose your favorite layout, your fancy animations with javascript to design. I decided to keep it simple and to just choose a background image for the div, that is the main container, but that could be your wonderland for your front end skills.



## Deployment on Github

First of all direct to the directory where your `config.toml` file is saved.
The first thing you should do is to change the baseURL to `baseURL = 'https://<YOUR USERNAME>.github.io/'`



First of all direct to the directory where your config.toml file is saved.

In this directory, what could be called blog you should call git init. You now have locally on your machine some posts, and you need to add them to your git. Therefore you need to call to check in all the files in your git repository.
```sh
<Directory-of-your-blog>$ git add .
<Directory-of-your-blog>$ git commit -m "<Your favorite commit message>
```
Once this is done, you need to create on github a repository. In order to do this, go to github


and click on new repository. Then give the repository your favorite name and add some description if you want.

Now you should see a the github repository setup site. As you already created a repository, the second block entitled with â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line is the one you are looking for.
```sh
<Directory-of-your-blog>$git remote add origin https://github.com/<Your Account>/<Your Reponame>.git
<Directory-of-your-blog>$git branch -M main
<Directory-of-your-blog>$git push -u origin main
```
Make sure that you use the github access token and not your old access password.

Next we need to create a new folder inside our blog project. So cd into the folder of the blog project. Note that the folders strictly need to have these following names:

```sh
mkdir .github
cd .github
mkdir workflows
```
Inside of the directory workflows create a file called gh-pages.yml. This file will be important, because it will allow to run the hugo methods in the github pages, i.e the pagination, the tagging will work online with the help of this file. You will need to paste the following in the gh-pages.yml file
``` name: github pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Set a branch to deploy
  pull_request:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          submodules: true  # Fetch Hugo themes (true OR recursive)
          fetch-depth: 0    # Fetch all history for .GitInfo and .Lastmod

      - name: Setup Hugo
        uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
        with:
          hugo-version: 'latest'
          # extended: true

      - name: Build
        run: hugo --minify

      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./public
```
This can be found as well in the hugo documentation. Next of course push this folders with this file to github. You need to make sure, that your access token allows you to change the workflow.
