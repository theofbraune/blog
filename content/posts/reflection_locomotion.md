In this post I will summarize the work on the virtual reality project and reflect a bit what I  

that it would create a lot of cyber-sickness. There are mainly two reasons for this. One reason is, that we are moving the head slightly when moving forwards. This reduces the conflict, that we are seeing the us moving forward although it is not. Furthermore the cubes in front if the player help a lot with the reduction of cybersickness, as they provide a fixed point.
