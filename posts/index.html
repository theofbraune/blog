Most of the conventional approaches use a wearable object like a chest belt or a special watch. In the mentioned cases, this is not applicable. Therefore one is interested in methods, that can extract the heart rate from a video feed.
This project was part of the evaluation of the Computer Vision introduction course at École Polytechnique and is mainly based on this article</div></article><article class="single-post border-bottom pb-4"><h2 class="entry-title mt-4 mb-4"><a href=https://theofbraune.github.io/blog/posts/3d-printing/>Make it Stand - Balancing Shapes for 3D-printing</a></h2><div class="post-meta mb-4"><span class=post-author>Posted by: Theo and Jingyi</span>

In 1994 Paul Milgram published with a work, where he introduced the idea of a Reality-Virtuality Continuum. You can think of it in the following way: With the rise of technology, like smartphones or in general some Silicon Valley Hardware device, the line between what is reality and what is virtual becomes more and more unclear.</div></article><article class="single-post border-bottom pb-4"><h2 class="entry-title mt-4 mb-4"><a href=https://theofbraune.github.io/blog/posts/dystopian_mixed_reality/>Mixed Reality and the Metaverse - A dystopian world?</a></h2><div class="post-meta mb-4"><span class=post-author>Posted by: Theo</span>
