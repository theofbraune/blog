<a href=https://theofbraune.github.io/blog/tags/ethics/>ethics</a></span></div><div class=entry-content><p>In the following I&rsquo;ll describe two fictional scenarios, how mixed reality technology could be abused. Some other inspiration for that can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJg02ivYzSs">here</a></p><h3 id=the-smart-ensurance>The &ldquo;smart&rdquo;-ensurance</h3><p>Imagine the following scenario. You are trapped in a YouTube loophole. You&rsquo;ve seen all the Gordon Ramsay-Best-Of videos and the ad&rsquo;s you see are all the same for hours. You watch for the fifth time the spot of this weird new and fictional Silicon Valley Company &ldquo;Exosmart&rdquo;.</p><figure><img src=../../images/vr-dystopian/logo-dystopian-startup.png width=50% height=50%></figure><p>Apparently their marketing team did a good job, because after you hear the same inspirational piano music and strangely calm off-voice again with the soft white background, you finally go to their website and look what they do.</p><p>You could find a text that is titled with <em>our vision</em> and read something like the following:</p><p><em><strong>Together with our partners, we at exosmart try to make a better tomorrow for you. For challenges that present themselves, we will be part of the solution. The combination of two worlds, where we build a bridge between the analog and the digital world with our products.</strong></em></p><p>Hmm ok, but what could that mean. You see that there is a promotion for the <em>all-in-one-healthy-set</em> for 69$. They wanna sell you some food balance, some wrist band, some food additionals, some add on for tracking glasses, and even some pads that you can put on your shoulders.</p><p>You think ok when <em>it helps to achieve my goals</em>, why not. So you place the order and a few days later you recive a package with the devices. You put on the wrist band and create your account. Immediately there comes a voice from the watch/wrist band telling you how great you are doing and that you got 10XP for the activation. &ldquo;Awesome, my first points&rdquo;. Thats so encouraging, because there is this cooperation of exosmart with this ensurance company</p><figure><img src=../../images/vr-dystopian/greedy-ensurance.png width=40% height=40%></figure><p>where a high score can lower your ensurance fee.</p><p>The exosmart-healthify score gets better and better when you use more of their devices. When you use the proposed ingredients from <strong>their partners</strong> the score grows even faster. The Exosmart-Pro-App told you, that with the enabled eye tracking for one year, the you can get a discount in the associated products. But as soon as time goes by, imagine the following: Your score goes down if you meet the wrong people, detected with the devices. The Exosmart-Healthvalue Team announces, that you will only get access to certain health-ensurance services, if your eye-tracking device notices, that you work sufficiently and follow only their partner products.</p><p>But you are attached to them to not lose your score. It has signs of the Stockholm-Syndrom. This <em>together with our partners we make your life better</em> is not more then a marketing strategy in order to capture very sensitive data and make use of the situation that someone wants/needs to reduce ensurance fees.</p><p>In order to brainstorm how one could avoid this kind of abuse for sensitive services, such as health there are several levels to discuss. First of all, there is the question whether it is necessary to fetch all these data such as the eye movement. But if it is possible to develop a technology like that, this simple idea of <em>if you don&rsquo;t wanna use it, don&rsquo;t use it</em> can be used to a certain extend, but it has limitations. I think we all know people around us, that refused for a long time to use Whatsapp, Messenger or to accept the Google Terms of Use, but finally accepted it although they didn&rsquo;t really want in order to be still part of a social group.</p><p>For regulation it is therefore difficult to prevent some kind of pressuring force. If this technology with eye tracking for self improving exists, one can discuss, whether it would be possible to use a decentralized method, that does not share the data with a server, as the collecting of this kind of sensitive data opens the door for abuse.
On the other hand, the massive analysis of personal data describes the success of companies like facebook.</p><p>In this <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/29/your-money/credit-score-alternatives-options.html>New York Times article</a> they describe a method to use social media profiles to score financial bonity. In my opinion that goes in the direction of the described fictional scenario.
At the same time, the article also implicitly points out issues that make such technology more susceptible to acceptance.<br>I think the main objective should be to get to such a point, that this idea of <em>if you don&rsquo;t wanna use it, don&rsquo;t use it</em> is applicable again. In the american credit scenario the acceptance is first of all to the lack of other possibilities to obtain a credit, so this concept is violated. In the case of health ensurance, probably the best and most reliable way is to provide a well working alternative.</p><h3 id=the-half-automatic-cook>The half-automatic cook</h3><p>Too busy for cooking, sick of instand noodles. You mentioned your wish of what you want to have for lunch. Of course your device knows which ingredients are left in the fridge, so it orders the missing stuff with a fresh goods delivery service. Then when it is time for the lunch break you are hungry for some fresh and home cooked food. It has a reason that you were not stingy when you planned this kitchen. But there are so many things left to do.</p><p>You tried that cooking robot before, but it was a disappointment. But there is this new technology, where they put electrodes on your arms and then a computer programm can stimulate your muscles, such that you you can move your arms, hands and shoulders and you don&rsquo;t need to think conciously about it. With the help of your VR-Glasses the Robo-Cook will see, what he needs to do. This allows you to have cutted vegetables, heated plates. But as you are not conciously cooking, you can work with your VR-Glasses on your work in parallel too.</p><p>Probably one would explain you, that this could optimize your efficiency. But once you take a step back and picture yourself remotely controlled in the kitchen, while discussing in parallel focussed in a video call some stuff for your work, you should question a bit what the heck you are doing. From todays perspective, this might seem really strange, but Amazon managed to sell a listening microphone in your living room as something you really need. But probably good marketing could overcome this feeling of discomfort.</p><p>But even if the discomfort is overcome, imagine this technology is being abused. You could create a remotely controlled killer for example.
Or in case that the automatic steering of your arms go wrong and damage is created. Who will take the legal liability? How could you prove, that the robot made a mistake and not you? Is it 100% your faut if you burn down a house, as you the arms were cooking for you.</p><p>I think it is important to make a distingtion between the person being remotely controlled Teamviewer-Like by someone else and being completely remotely controlled by a computer, as in the cooking scenario. In this case, we can already speak of a real robot, as an artificial source. For this case, the Azimovs Laws of Robotics where introduced and are well applicable.</p><p>But as I am writing this post, I find an application, that is actually not that far away from the described <a href=https://robbreport.com/gear/electronics/moley-robotics-robot-kitchen-uk-for-sale-1234590791/>scenario.</a> So, we can be curious what we are going to expere in this direction in the next years.</p></div></article></div></main><footer id=site-footer class="bg-dark text-white pb-4 pt-4"><div class=container><div class="copyright text-center">&copy;2022Maths of Glory</div></div></footer><script src=../../js/bootstrap.min.js></script></body></html>
