Most of the conventional approaches use a wearable object like a chest belt or a special watch. In the mentioned cases, this is not always applicable. Therefore one is interested in methods, that can extract the heart rate from a video feed. This post gives a first overview how a code prototype for that could be build.</description></item><item><title>Make it Stand - Balancing Shapes for 3D-printing</title><link>https://theofbraune.github.io/blog/posts/3d-printing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2022 18:00:10 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://theofbraune.github.io/blog/posts/3d-printing/</guid><description>Through the evolution of 3D-printers, the it has become more and more easy to produce prototypes of 3 dimensional shapes. In this project we developed our first software to produce shapes and printable objects for a 3D-printer. This project was part as a final project of the Ã‰cole Polytechnique course X-INF 574 Digital Representations and Analysis of Shapes</description></item><item><title>Implementation of Ski Locomotion in Virtual Reality.</title><link>https://theofbraune.github.io/blog/posts/implementation_locom/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2022 14:29:19 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://theofbraune.github.io/blog/posts/implementation_locom/</guid><description>In this post I explain how I implemented cross country skiing as a locomotion technique in a VR parcours.</description></item></channel></rss>
