      <title>Heart Rate Measurement through Computer Vision</title>
      <link>https://theofbraune.github.io/blog/posts/heart_rate_measurement/</link>

      <description>For many applications in telemedicine or in a security context a contactless heart rate measurement can be great interest useful. Most of the conventional approaches use a wearable object like a chest belt or a special watch. In the mentioned cases, this is not always applicable. Therefore one is interested in methods, that can extract the heart rate from a video feed. This post gives a first overview how a code prototype for that could be build.</description>

      <description>Through the evolution of 3D-printers, the it has become more and more easy to produce prototypes of 3 dimensional shapes. In this project we developed our first software to produce shapes and printable objects for a 3D-printer. This project was part as a final project of the École Polytechnique course X-INF 574 Digital Representations and Analysis of Shapes</description>

      <description>In this post I will summarize the work on the virtual reality project and reflect a bit what I experienced in the implementation process. First of all I should point out that unity is an extremely powerful platform and is easy to use, when having some programming experience. All these things like collision, drag and mass otherwise would be difficult to implement.</description>
