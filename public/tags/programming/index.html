You will need to complete the class methods in the class ConformalParametrization that you will find in the file conformal.cpp. In order to see the goal of the TP, you can press 4 to use the pre-build Libigl method of the conformal parametrization on the mesh.

Most of the conventional approaches use a wearable object like a chest belt or a special watch. In the mentioned cases, this is not always applicable. Therefore one is interested in methods, that can extract the heart rate from a video feed.

This project was part as a final project of the École Polytechnique course &ldquo;X-INF 573 Digital Representations and Analysis of Shapes&rdquo;.
The aim of this project was to give an input shape, define an angle an orientation axis and then to carve out and deform the shape, such that the new modified shape can stand in this desired position.</div>

First of all I should point out that unity is an extremely powerful platform and is easy to use, when having some programming experience. All these things like collision, drag and mass otherwise would be difficult to implement.
In the implementation process I was often improvising a bit to overcome difficulties.</div>

First I went to the official unity page. This article assumes, that you have not installed unity yet. Thus you need to download the unity hub.
In this article I am using Windows, but the steps for the other operating systems are not that different. Of course you need to accept the unity licence agreement.</div>

I used the environment build by Wen-Jie Tseng, that he provided for our class under this link.
