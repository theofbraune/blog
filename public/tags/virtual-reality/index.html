First of all I should point out that unity is an extremely powerful platform and is easy to use, when having some programming experience. All these things like collision, drag and mass otherwise would be difficult to implement.
In the implementation process I was often improvising a bit to overcome difficulties.</div>

First I went to the official unity page. This article assumes, that you have not installed unity yet. Thus you need to download the unity hub.
In this article I am using Windows, but the steps for the other operating systems are not that different. Of course you need to accept the unity licence agreement.</div>

In order to get started, select Assets/Create/Scene. In the assets tab of the editor you should now see an icon new scene.</div>

The overall idea will be, that you have to move your arms from top to down, and this then gives you a push. I used the environment build by Wen-Jie Tseng, that he provided for our class under this link. This was my starting point, to modify the position of the OVRCamera Rig with its controllers, in order to move.</div>

In 1994 Paul Milgram published with a work, where he introduced the idea of a Reality-Virtuality Continuum. You can think of it in the following way: With the rise of technology, like smartphones or in general some Silicon Valley Hardware device, the line between what is reality and what is virtual becomes more and more unclear.</div>
