 In this article I am using Windows, but the steps for the other operating systems are not that different. Of course you need to accept the unity licence agreement. Then you will see a window for the install location of the unity hub.  As I understood it, you can consider the unity hub as something, that will load for you all the utils from the big unity machinery (like shaders, libraries&hellip;) that you&rsquo;ll need for a good game.</div>

In 1994 Paul Milgram published with a work, where he introduced the idea of a Reality-Virtuality Continuum. You can think of it in the following way: With the rise of technology, like smartphones or in general some Silicon Valley Hardware device, the line between what is reality and what is virtual becomes more and more unclear.</div>
