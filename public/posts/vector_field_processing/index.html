<h2 id="1-precalculate-the-mesh-information">1. Precalculate the mesh information</h2>
<p>To calculate vector fields for discrete surfaces, we will use a class, where we precalculate different quantities that will come in handy for the calculation. You will calculate these quantities directly in the constructor of the class <code>Mesh</code>. In this TP, we will define subsequently a class <code>ElectricMesh</code> that will inherit from this class.</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> For the following task, there are multiple ways to calculate intrinsic mesh quantities. You can use the half-edge data structure that you have seen already in TD4, but you do not have to use it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>In a first step, we want you to prepare a class <code>Mesh</code> to precompute all necessary mesh information. Further, we want you to compute the barycentric and voronoi dual complex. To compute the Voronoi dual complex, you need to calculate the circumcenter of the primal triangles. For the barycentric dual complex, you need to compute the barycenters. The dual complex is no longer a simplicial complex; we cannot represent it with a <code>Eigen::MatrixXd V</code> and <code>Eigen::MatrixXi F</code>. A priori we cannot tell the number of vertices in a dual face. Therefore, we will use a <code>std::vector&lt; std::vector&lt; int&gt;&gt;</code> where each entry contains the indices of the dual vertices. As in the simplicial case, the order of the vertices will determine the face.</li>
</ol>
<p>The disadvantage of the Voronoi dual complex is that for a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; mesh, with obtuse triangles, the circumcenter may lie far outside the triangle.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/vector_field_proc/bad_mesh_for_input.png" width="30%" height="30%">
  </figure>

<p>The advantage of the Voronoi dual complex compared to the barycentric dual complex is that the dual edges are necessarily perpendicular to the primal edges. However, for the barycentric dual complex, the dual vertices will always lie inside the faces.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/vector_field_proc/barycentric_non_perp.png" width="30%" height="30%">
  </figure>

<p>However, if your mesh is sufficiently &ldquo;nice&rdquo;, the vertices in the dual complex will lie inside the primal triangles, and primal and dual edges intersect perpendicular.</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> Complete the method <code>build_dual_complex</code> and <code>compute_edges</code>. We provide you with a class <code>Visualizer</code> to create wireframes and vector fields. The method <code>get_wireframe_from_edges(const MatrixXd&amp; V, const std::vector&lt;Edge&gt;&amp; edges, MatrixXd&amp; V_wireframe, MatrixXi&amp; F_wireframe, double radius)</code> constructs for a given set of points and edges, that are formed out of these points a novel (triangular) mesh, that can be attached to the viewer. Once the wireframe is formed, you can attach this new mesh to the viewer through</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><ul>
<li>Experiment with different the Voronoi Dual and the barycentric dual. Create figures and attach screenshots to your submission.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a second step, you have to initialize a basis for every tangent space. We will store the basis as a <code>std::vector&lt; std::pair&lt; MatrixXd,MatrixXd&gt;&gt;</code>, make sure that you are using an orthonormal basis. These basis will later in the TD allow to encode represent face-based vector fields and to encode parallel transport between primal faces.
To debug, you can use the provided method <code>visualize_basis</code>, you might need to play with the parameters for scaling and the radius of the tubes in order to get a good result.

  </figure>
</p>
<p>However, you need to make sure that your basis are chosen in a consistent manner, such that they can be aligned with an angle. It might be necessary to flip the order of the vectors in the basis. This means, in particular, that you should avoid a situation like that:

<h2 id="2-hodge-helmholtz-decomposition-and-electrostatics">2. Hodge-Helmholtz-Decomposition and Electrostatics</h2>
<p>In this part, we want to compute vertex-based vector fields and calculate electric fields on surfaces. For the code, you will fill in the methods in the class <code>ElectricMesh</code> that inherits from the class <code>Mesh.</code> The overall idea will be that you define a charge density $\rho$ on the surface. Every charge density induces an electric field $E$ satisfying Gauss&rsquo; and Faraday&rsquo;s law, i.e</p>
<p>$$
\mathrm{div}(E) = \rho, \quad \text{and} \quad \mathrm{curl}(E) = 0.
$$</p>
<p>As you have seen in the lecture about Hodge-Helmholtz-Decomposition, you can decompose any vector field into the sum of a curl-free vector field, the gradient of a scalar field, and a harmonic component. In the case of electrostatic, the harmonic component can be neglected, such that there exists an electric potential $\phi$ such that</p>
<p>$$
E = -\mathrm{grad}(\phi).
$$</p>
<p>You can solve for this potential by taking the divergence on both sides, leading to</p>
<p>$$
\mathrm{div}(E) = -\mathrm{div}\ \mathrm{grad}(\phi) = -\Delta\phi,
$$</p>
<p>hence</p>
<p>$$
-\Delta \phi = \rho.
$$</p>
<p>Since we have established the Laplacian for triangulated surfaces, we can now solve for the electric potential. However, you need to ensure that the equation is solvable.</p>
<p>Given a mesh, let $\Delta = A^{-1} L$ be the Laplace-Beltrami operator, where $A$ is the mass matrix and $L$ contains the cotangent weights. You have seen that on any closed surface, the dimension of the kernel of the Laplacian is equal to the number of its connected components, hence in our case $1$. Since we assume that the mesh is non-degenerated, the mass matrix containing the Voronoi areas of the vertices is a diagonal, symmetric, positive definite matrix.</p>
<p>Let $\mathbb{R}^{|V|}$ be the space of discrete scalar-valued functions; then $A$ induces a scalar product on this space through</p>
<p>$$
\langle u, v\rangle:= u^T A v.
$$</p>
<p>The Laplace-Beltrami operator is self-adjoint w.r.t this scalar product, since</p>
<p>$$
\langle\Delta u, v\rangle = u^T L^T (A^T)^{-1}A v\rangle = u^T L v = u^T A A^{-1}L v = \langle u, \Delta v\rangle.
$$</p>
<p>You know from Linear Algebra that you can, therefore, decompose</p>
<p>$$
\mathbb{R}^{|V|} = \mathcal{I}(\Delta)\oplus_{\perp}\mathcal{N}(\Delta),
$$</p>
<p>where the orthogonality is to be understood with respect to the aforementioned scalar product. To ensure the solvability of the equation—i.e., ensure that $\rho\in \mathcal{I}(\Delta)$—we will project $\rho$ onto the image. To do that note that $1\in \mathbb{R}^{|V|}$, i.e., the function that is $1$ at every vertex satisfies $1\in \mathcal{N}(\Delta)$, thus $\mathcal{N}(\Delta) = \mathrm{span}(1)$. Hence, we need to ensure that $\langle 1, \rho\rangle = 0$. The projection onto the image of the Laplacian can, therefore, be computed as</p>
<p>$$
\rho_i \leftarrow \rho_i - \frac{\sum_{j}\rho_j A_{jj}}{\sum_j A_{jj}},
$$</p>
<p>where $A_{jj}$ denotes the Voronoi area of the $j-$th vertex.</p>

<p><strong>Remark:</strong>
For a triangle consisting of the vertices $[v_i, v_j, v_k]$, the gradient of a function $u$ defined on the vertices -evaluated at the barycenter $c$ of the triangle- can be calculated as</p>
<p>$$(\nabla u)_c = \frac{1}{3}\left((u_i-u_j)(v_i-v_j) + (u_j-u_k)(v_j-v_k) + (u_k-u_i)(v_k-v_i) \right).$$</p>

<h2 id="3-vector-field-processing-with-discrete-connections">3. Vector Field Processing with Discrete Connections</h2>
<p>In this part of the TP we want to calculate face based vector fields on discrete surfaces that arise through parallel transport with a trivial connection.</p>
<h3 id="trivial-connections-and-parallel-transport">Trivial Connections and Parallel Transport</h3>
<p>Now, we want to calculate face-based vector fields that arise through parallel transport of a trivial connection on a discrete surface. For the following tasks, you will use the class <code>SolverMesh</code> that inherits from the class <code>Mesh</code> from TD 8. To perform this task, you must have defined the dual faces (<code>F_dual</code>) in the class <code>Mesh</code>. Further, you need to have set a basis for each face (<code>bases_tangent_spaces</code>).</p>
<p>There had been a minor update to the class <code>Visualizer</code> compared to TD8. I overloaded the method <code>build_face_based_vector_field</code> so that you can, in the end, visualize the vector field just by passing the <code>SolverMesh</code> instance.</p>
<p>A detailed description of the algorithm that you will implement can be found in the <a href="https://pages.saclay.inria.fr/mathieu.desbrun/pubs/CDS10.pdf">original publication</a>.</p>
<h4 id="1-calculation-of-the-discrete-levi-civita-connection">1) Calculation of the Discrete Levi-Civita Connection</h4>
<p>In a first step, we will calculate the Levi-Civita Connection for the mesh. In the constructor of the class <code>Mesh</code>, you have already defined an orthonormal basis for every tangent space. A discrete connection on the discrete tangent bundle is a linear map per dual edge mapping from adjacent tangent planes to each other. As you have seen in the lecture, the Levi-Civita Connection can be obtained through the following procedure:</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/vector_field_proc/levi_civita_illustration.png" width="40%" height="40%">
</figure>

<p>Once the tangent planes are folded out in a plane, the bases can be aligned with a 2D rotation.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/vector_field_proc/aligning_angles.gif" width="30%" height="30%">
</figure>

<p>It is now your task to calculate this angle per dual edge and store it in the range $[-\pi,\pi]$. Complete the method <code>compute_adjustment_angles</code> and store, for every edge, the frame adjustment angle in the vector <code>adjustment_angle_frames</code>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you do not have to unfold your triangles actively to get this rotation. Instead, you can align the first vector of your basis of your start face with the shared edge and subsequently do the same with the first vector of the basis of your second face.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/vector_field_proc/get_levi_civita_connection.png" width="40%" height="40%">
</figure>

<h4 id="2-calculation-of-the-holonomy">2) Calculation of the Holonomy</h4>
<p>Once the Levi-Civita connection/adjustment angles are calculated, you can calculate the holonomy around each basis cycle by computing the sum of the adjustment angles. Complete the method <code>compute_holonomy</code>.</p>
<p>The sum of your adjustment angles should amount to an integer multiple of $2\pi$ (the number of turns in your cycle) to the Gaussian curvature of each vertex. Using the header <code>&lt; igl / gaussian_curvature.h&gt;</code>, we provide you a piece of code to verify whether your angle defect satisfies this. Once you checked your results, overwrite the variable <code>holonomy</code> with the values of the holonomy for every basis cycle around every vertex.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/vector_field_proc/target_holonomy.JPG" width="30%" height="30%">
</figure>

<p>We highly recommend using the class <code>Visualizer</code> for visual debugging. If you realize, for example, that your calculations work for some edges but not for others, you can mark them (for example using the variable <code>bad_edges</code>) and visualize them separately, as in the figure below. Like that, you might discover specific patterns where something might have gone wrong in the first place.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/vector_field_proc/debugging_visual_for_sanity.JPG" width="30%" height="30%">
</figure>

<p>If $\mathcal{B}_ a, \mathcal{B}_ b$ describe the bases of the tangent spaces $f_a$, resp. $f_b$, let $v$ be a tangent vector in $f_a$ and $v&rsquo;$ be the tangent vector in $f_b$ that arises through parallel transport with the Levi-Civita connection along the dual edge $e_{a,b}$. Let<br>
$[v]_{\mathcal{B}_ a}, [v&rsquo;]_{\mathcal{B}_ b}\in \mathbb{R}^2$ be the coordinate vectors of $v,v&rsquo;$ in the respective bases. In this case, the parallel transport can be expressed via
$$
[v&rsquo;]_{\mathcal{B}_ b} = \begin{pmatrix} \cos(\theta_{ab})&amp; -\sin(\theta_{ab})\\ \sin(\theta_{ab})&amp; \cos(\theta_{ab})\end{pmatrix}[v]_{\mathcal{B}_ a}
$$</p>
<h4 id="3-calculation-of-basis-cycles">3) Calculation of Basis Cycles</h4>
<p>In order to compute a trivial connection we need to handle the holonomy around every cycle on the mesh. Any cycle that is the boundary of a 2D domain can be constructed as the union of boundaries of 1-ring cycles around vertices, that are already computed. Thus, surfaces of genus $0$ can be entirely handled like that.
If you want to continue to work with the bunny, for example, you can skip this step and go directly to step 4).</p>
<p>However, on surfaces with $g&gt;0$ this is not sufficient. There exist cycles that are not the boundary of a 2D domain (more formally, those surfaces have a non-trivial first homology group). Complete the method <code>compute_homology_generators()</code> to find these basic non-contractible cycles. You will represent the generators as a sequence of integers in a <code>std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;int&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>As one of the possible ways to traverse a mesh, we will construct a spanning tree of the primal mesh (in the figure in green) in a first step. Subsequently, we will calculate a spanning tree of the dual mesh (in the figure in blue) whose edges do not cross the edges of the primal spanning tree.
<figure><img src="../../images/vector_field_proc/tree_cotree_decomposition.png" width="30%" height="30%">
</figure>
</p>
<p>Let $g$ be the genus of the surface. The Euler characteristic of the mesh is given by
$$ |V| - |E| + |F| = 2 - 2g. $$
To calculate the generators of the first homology group, note that
$$ (|V| - 1) + (|F| - 1) + 2g = |E|. $$</p>
<p>The calculation shows that there are $2g$ many edges left that are neither in the dual nor in the primal spanning tree. You can now search these $2g$ edges and follow the vertices of these edges to the root of the dual spanning tree. The result will be a non-contractible cycle; a generator of the first homology group of your surface.</p>
<p><figure><img src="../../images/vector_field_proc/homology_generators.png" width="30%" height="30%">
</figure>

<figure><img src="../../images/vector_field_proc/generators_higher_order.png" width="30%" height="30%">
</figure>
</p>
<p>We provide you with a class <code>VertexTree</code> that you can use to build these trees. Complete the method <code>compute_homology_generators</code>. We provide you with some basis code in this method that can serve as a basis to finish this task. However, feel free to implement it in your favorite way. If you want to define an extra class, feel free to do so!</p>
<h4 id="4-build-the-left-hand-side-of-the-linear-system">4) Build the left-hand side of the linear system:</h4>
<p>It will be the aim to prescribe the holonomy around the basis cycles (i.e., the cycles of the one-ring neighborhood of each vertex and the chosen homology generators). This means we will set a constraint on the sum of the angles that we assign to the edges. We will work with edges—not half edges. In the constructor of the class <code>Mesh</code>, make sure that you store a single copy of a (dual) edge. The orientation is arbitrary. For example, if the vertices $3$ and $4$ are connected, you can either store <code>Edge(3,4)</code> or <code>Edge(4,3)</code> in the vector <code>Edges</code> resp. <code>dual_edges</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
For a given cell complex,
<figure><img src="../../images/vector_field_proc/sample_cell_complex.png" width="40%" height="40%">
   </figure>
</p>
<p>the 6th row of the &ldquo;cycle matrix&rdquo; will have the form
$$ A = \begin{pmatrix}
&amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\
+1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; +1 &amp; 0 &amp; +1 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots \\
&amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;
\end{pmatrix} \in \{ -1,0,1 \}^{(|V|+2g) \times |E|}. $$</p>
<p>Consider all retractable basis cycles, i.e., the one-ring neighborhood around each vertex. Construct the cycle matrix exclusively for these cycles, denoted as $d_0^T \in \mathbb{R}^{|V| \times |E|}$. We refer to it as $d_0^T$ for reasons we won&rsquo;t delve into here.</p>
<p>The calculation of signs for angles is not only necessary for the one-ring neighborhood but also for the homology generators. The resulting matrix obtained for the consideration of the basis cycles, denoted as $G \in \mathbb{R}^{2g \times |E|}$, is essential. To form the complete cycle matrix $A$, stack them together:
$$ A = \begin{pmatrix} d_0 \ G \end{pmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{(|V|+2g) \times |E|} $$</p>
<p>In the <code>build_LHS</code> method of the <code>SolverMesh</code> class, these matrices are constructed.</p>
<h4 id="5-preparation-of-the-singularities">5) Preparation of the Singularities</h4>
<p>In the case of electrostatics, we needed to manipulate the input to ensure the existence of a solution. For trivial connections, we need to do something similar. Imagine we would solve for adjustment angles \( \theta \) through the linear system
$$ A \cdot \theta = -\text{Gaussian Curvature}, $$
the vector field that would arise through parallel transport with this connection would have no singularities.</p>
<p>However, we will not be able to realize this for general surfaces since we have an additional constraint. You may have heard of the &ldquo;hairy ball theorem,&rdquo; i.e., that it is impossible to comb hair on a sphere without having a bald spot.
Therefore, you will need to specify specific positions where you want to have singularities and their degree and where not. In the method <code>build_RHS_for_problem</code>, you should specify the vertices or basis cycles on which you want to have the singularities and which degree the singularities should have. Store them in the vector <code>singularities</code>. You can use the method <code>check_RHS_for_consistency</code> in order to verify whether you chose them in such a way that this results in a solvable system. Once the singularities are specified, you can build specify the target holonomies for the linear solve through:</p>

<p>In the following step, complete the method <code>solve_for_angles</code>. Solve the problem

To do that, you can use a CG solver such as <code>LeastSquaresConjugateGradient&lt;SparseMatrix&lt;double&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong> Convince yourself that this procedure indeed leads to a trivial connection and that parallel transport is now path independent. Imagine you connect two points on the mesh with two different paths. Why will the parallel transport for this novel discrete connection be the same for the two paths?</p>
<h4 id="7-compute-the-vector-field">7) Compute the Vector Field</h4>
<p>Once the adjustment angles per dual edge are computed, the trivial connection per edge can be obtained by composing the rotation matrix from the Levi-Civita connection with a rotation by the angle adjustment we obtained through the linear solve.</p>
<p>If $\mathcal{B}_a, \mathcal{B}_b$ describe the bases of the tangent spaces $f_a$, resp. $f_b$, let $v$ be a tangent vector in $f_a$ and $v&rsquo;$ be the tangent vector in $f_b$ that arises through parallel transport with the trivial connection along the dual edge $e_{a,b}$. Now, let $\alpha_{ab}$ be the adjustment angle that we obtain through the linear solve. As above let $\theta_{ab}$ the adjustment angle encoding the Levi-Civita connection for the dual edge $e_{ab}$.

$[v]_{\mathcal{B}_a}, [v&rsquo;]_{\mathcal{B}_b}\in \mathbb{R}^2$ are the coordinate vectors of $v,v&rsquo;$ in the respective bases, the parallel transport with the trivial connection can be expressed via
$$[v&rsquo;]_{\mathcal{B}_b} = \begin{pmatrix} \cos(\theta_{ab} + \alpha_{ab})&amp; -\sin(\theta_{ab} + \alpha_{ab})\\ \sin(\theta_{ab} + \alpha_{ab})&amp; \cos(\theta_{ab} + \alpha_{ab})\end{pmatrix}[v]_{\mathcal{B}_a}$$</p>
<p>Complete the method <code>compute_transported_vector_field</code> and overwrite the variable <code>parallel_transported_field</code>.</p>
<p>To do that, pick one face of the mesh and place one vector there. Now, for the trivial connection, parallel transport is path independent. Hence we can transport this chosen vector into every other tangent space, for example using the dual spanning tree.</p>
<p>To finish, you can as before visualize the vector field with the provided method <code>build_face_based_vector_field</code>, that will overwrite a wireframe which can subsequently serve to visualize the vector field.</p>
<p>Observe that the obtained vector field has only singularities for the chosen cycles.</p>
