The overall idea will be, that you have to move your arms from top to down, and this then gives you a push.  I used the environment build by Wen-Jie Tseng, that he provided for our class under this <a href="https://github.com/wenjietseng/VR-locomotion-parkour">link</a>. This was my starting point, to modify the position of the OVRCamera Rig with its controllers, in order to move. My process in order to get there is described in this post.

<p>In the first part of my implementation, when playing with the given locomotion technique, I realized, that I can enter the ground.
<figure><img src="../../images/implementation_loco/hitting-the-street.PNG" width="30%" height="30%"/>
</figure>

As I want to move forward on the ground, one needs to avoid this. In order to understand how one could prevent this and how the VR-Steering in general works, I first implemented a very simple locomotion with a joystick, where I take the x-value and associate it to the speed that the player will feel. Then I took the normalized forward vector of the head mounted display to move forward. As I want to stay on the ground and do not want to move in the air, I took the projection onto the x-z-plane with the <code>hmd.forward</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-code" data-lang="code">void FixedUpdate()
    {
        Vector2 rightjoystickval = OVRInput.Get(OVRInput.Axis2D.PrimaryThumbstick, rightController);
        //how much forward
        speed = rightjoystickval[1];

        Vector3 forward_bef = hmd.transform.forward;

        Vector3 forward = new Vector3(forward_bef[0], 0.0f, forward_bef[2]);
    }
</code></pre><p>This script mainly allows to read the values of the joystick. The further the joystick is moved forwards, the more speed we want. It fetches additionally the direction of the head mounted display and will add a force in this direction. As we do not want to move upwards, we set the y-component to zero.
In order to access the rigidbody in my script, I declared a public variable <code>public Rigidbody rbdy</code> in the header of the file.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-code" data-lang="code">public class LocomotionTechnique : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Rigidbody rbdy;
    [...]
}
</code></pre><p>To link them, I just dragged in the unity editor the rigidbody component into the public variable of the script.
<figure><img src="../../images/implementation_loco/define-rigidbody-for-script.PNG" width="40%" height="40%"/>
</figure>

Make sure that you untick the <code>isKinematic</code> in the rigidbody.
<figure><img src="../../images/implementation_loco/untick-kinematic.PNG" width="30%" height="30%"/>
</figure>

In order to solve this issue of entering the street, my first idea was to use a second collider, but there seemed to be a problem, because if the new collider is not a trigger, we will bounce of the coins and cannot collect them. Thus I tried to activate and deactivate the trigger of the collider in the script in such a way, that if I hit the street, the trigger is false. I used the call
<code>this.GetComponent&lt;Collider&gt;().isTrigger = false</code>
If the collider detected, that the collision object is a banner or a coin, I reset the trigger to true. But there was still an issue, because this action is not fast enough. That means, that we hit a coin, collide hard, and then the coin can be collected. To overcome this issue, I used a little dirty hack, in such a way, that I manually defined the y-position. I placed 8 cubes in the area of the bridge and manually checked their positions.
<figure><img src="../../images/implementation_loco/bridge-parcours-with-cubes.PNG" width="60%" height="60%"/>
</figure>

These cubes allow us to determine whether the player is in the bridge zone. If it is outside, I manually set the height to 0.5, if it is inside, I can use a linear function in order to determine the y-coordinate inbetween, where I use the ground and up y-coordinate and the z-coordinate.</p>

</code></pre><p>In the game in the end, this method seems quite smooth and floorless, but of course, jumping is a little problem with that; coins one need to jump for will be unachievable.</p>
<p>With the boolean information, whether we are going uphill/downhill, I then added some drag to the rigidbody, such that it is harder/easier to move forward.</p>
<p>Now in order to get the ski locomotion right, my plan was to place 4 cubes in front of the player and then to measure, whether the controller move from the upper box to the lower box and if they do, to add a force.
In order to do this, I attached a game object to the <code>CenterEyeAnchor</code>, where I place 4 cubes. In order to place them, I used the Oculus link to debug, when they have a good position.
<figure><img src="../../images/implementation_loco/create_cubes.PNG" width="30%" height="30%"/>
</figure>
</p>
<p>First I checked the upper cubes and placed them by hand, next I placed the lower cubes and tested, that a natural ski stroke movement is from the upper to the lower cube.
<figure><img src="../../images/implementation_loco/cubes_better.PNG" width="30%" height="30%"/>
</figure>
</p>
<p>Next I assigned some materials to the cubes.
<figure><img src="../../images/implementation_loco/add_material_to_cube.PNG" width="30%" height="30%"/>
</figure>
</p>
<p>When I tried to start the game now on my Oculus, I realised, that I cannot pass the first banner, thats because the added cubes all have attached colliders and they need to be triggers, thus, set the trigger to all the 4 box colliders of the added cubes.
<figure><img src="../../images/implementation_loco/set_trigger_collider.PNG" width="30%" height="30%"/>
</figure>

I experimented a bit with positions until I was happy with the size and positions of the cubes. I made the lower cubes a bit larger, cause if they are too small it might be, that a stroke does not trigger a push.
<figure><img src="../../images/implementation_loco/cubes_final.PNG" width="30%" height="30%"/>
</figure>
</p>
<p>In the next step, we somehow need to detect, whether we hit with the controller the cubes, in order trigger a push. To do that, I declared 4 public GameObject variables in the locomotion script with boolean variables, that will indicate whether we are in one of the cubes. Then I attached in the unity inspector the cubes we just moved around to the Locomotion script.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/implementation_loco/attached_cubes.PNG" width="30%" height="30%"/>
</figure>

<p>Next in order to check if the <code>LeftHandAnchor</code> is inside the box or not, I attached a new script to the left (and then right) hand anchor. In the project window, drag them over to the <code>Scripts</code> folder.
Now, we additionally need to add a box collider to the Controllers/Anchors. Make sure to tick the <code>isTrigger</code> again. There one needs to be careful, because by default the collider of the Anchors has not the same size as the collider of the boxes.
<figure><img src="../../images/implementation_loco/anchor_box_collider_too_big.PNG" width="30%" height="30%"/>
</figure>
</p>
<p>Thus it might be, that the collider of the anchor is at the same time in the upper and the lower cube, and our locomotion scipt has a problem. In my case, scaling the collider by around 0.1 does the trick.
<figure><img src="../../images/implementation_loco/right_size_box_collider.PNG" width="50%" height="50%"/>
</figure>
</p>
<p>In order to access the information of the collider of the controller, I defined public variables for the <code>ColliderLeft</code> and <code>ColliderRight</code> in the header of the LocomotionTechnique script.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-code" data-lang="code">public class LocomotionTechnique : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Please implement your locomotion technique in this script. 
    public OVRInput.Controller leftController;
    public OVRInput.Controller rightController;
    [...]
}
</code></pre><p>In the Inspector of the LocomotionScript click on the right circle and select your script.
<figure><img src="../../images/implementation_loco/drag_script_to_locomotion.PNG" width="50%" height="50%"/>
</figure>
</p>
<p>Next we need to write the script for ColliderLeft and ColliderRight. In order to do that, we need to check, if the handle is in the upper box, then set a boolean variable on true for that, and we set it back to false, when we leave the box again.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-code" data-lang="code">public class ColliderLeft : MonoBehaviour
{
    public bool in_left_up = false;
    public bool in_left_down = false;
    [...]
    void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
    {
        if (other.CompareTag(&#34;cube_left_up&#34;))
        {
            in_left_up = true;
            

        }
        else if (other.CompareTag(&#34;cube_left_down&#34;))
        {
            
            in_left_down = true;
        }
    }
    void OnTriggerExit(Collider other)
    {
        if (other.CompareTag(&#34;cube_left_up&#34;))
        {
            in_left_up = false;

        }
        else if (other.CompareTag(&#34;cube_left_down&#34;))
        {
            in_left_down = false;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Note, that it is necessary for that to give a tag to each of the cubes. Furthermore you need to add to your left and RightHandAnchor a Rigidbody! Only in this case unity can detect the collision. Trust me, painful debugging time was needed for this insight.
As the variables like <code>in_right_up</code> are defined as public in the script, we can read them out in the main locomotion script. This can be done with the following call:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-code" data-lang="code">    in_down_left = collider_left.in_left_down;
    in_up_left = collider_left.in_left_up;
    in_down_right = collider_right.in_right_down;
    in_up_right = collider_right.in_right_up;
</code></pre><p>Now this is what we want, like that we get in each frame the information, whether our handle is in the upper or lower box.</p>
<p>The logical steps are to check, is the handle in the upper box. Does it move from there to the lower box, if so, trigger a push.
I measure the time it takes, and the faster it is, the bigger the push is going to be.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-code" data-lang="code">    //check whether we are in the upper left box with the handle, measure the time
    if ((in_up_left) &amp; (!in_down_left))
    {
        started_left = true;
        t1_left = Time.time;
    }
    //check whether we are in the lower box. Measure the time for the first appearence.
    if (((started_left) &amp; (in_down_left)))
    {
        if (arrived_left == false)
        {
            t2_left = Time.time;
            arrived_left = true;
        }
        
    }
</code></pre><p>Of course, you need to add the same call for the right handle.
Now you should be able to move by going up and down with the controllers from the boxes. I experimented a little bit how to set the natural drag, to slow down again and the force from the push. It turned out, that for the plane a drag value of 0.4 seems quite fun.
When going downhill, I add a drag of -0.1, so that you accelerate when decending. But in order to get into the next corner, we need to brake down.
<figure><img src="../../images/implementation_loco/corner-downhill.PNG" width="50%" height="50%"/>
</figure>

If you do not brake, you will just fly off the corner.
I just use the value of the right <code>PrimaryIndexTrigger</code> and add a large drag according to this value. Before the push, I add a condition of the form</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-code" data-lang="code">private void FixedUpdate()
    {
        brake = OVRInput.Get(OVRInput.Axis1D.PrimaryIndexTrigger, rightController);
        [...]
        if (brake &gt; 0.1f)
        {
            rbdy.drag = 2 * brake;
        }
    }
</code></pre><p>From now on, I played a bit and modified the application a bit more. I added for example 2 ski rigs to the hands.
<figure><img src="../../images/implementation_loco/create-cylinder-children.PNG" width="30%" height="30%"/>
</figure>
</p>
<p>Then I played around until they have the right size.
<figure><img src="../../images/implementation_loco/play-with-cylinder-sizes.PNG" width="30%" height="30%"/>
</figure>
</p>
<p>Next, to create an even more authentic experience, I added a haptic feedback to the controllers, when performing the stroke. To trigger the haptic feedback, you can add in the script the line <code>OVRInput.SetControllerVibration(1,1,leftController)</code> this triggers the vibration of the controller. Oculus claims that you can also give a direct feedback for a predefined time, but this did not really work for me, therefore I measured the time of the push, if more then 0.1 seconds are elapsed, the vibration becomes disabled by  <code>OVRInput.SetControllerVibration(0,0,leftController)</code>. This can be performed by the following code</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-code" data-lang="code">private void FixedUpdate()
    {
        [...]
        if (arrived_left)
        {
            collider_left.triggered_left = true;
            OVRInput.SetControllerVibration(1, 1, leftController);
            trigger_haptic_left = true;
            start_trigger_left = Time.time;
        }
        if (trigger_haptic_left)
        {
            //check whether we need to trigger the haptics
            if ((Time.time - start_trigger_left) &gt; 0.1f)
            {
                OVRInput.SetControllerVibration(0, 0, leftController);
                trigger_haptic_left = false;
            }

        }
    }
</code></pre><p>(Simultaniously for the right one as well of course)
Furthermore the call of <code>collider_left.triggered_left</code> allows us to pass the information, that the stroke is performed to the script of the left and right anchor. As we already have a sound attached to the OVRCameraRig through the coins, we can add there the noise of hitting snow. I added an audio component to the Left and Right Anchor.
<figure><img src="../../images/implementation_loco/add-audio-source.PNG" width="30%" height="30%"/>
</figure>

Then I bought from <a href="https://www.soundsnap.com/tags/snow">soundsnap</a> a audio tag, that gives you the sound, when you step on snow.
I added the downloaded soundfile to the Sounds folder in the Assets folder of the game.
<figure><img src="../../images/implementation_loco/add-sound.PNG" width="40%" height="40%"/>
</figure>

Then add the snow sound to the AudioSource of the HandAnchor.
<figure><img src="../../images/implementation_loco/add-audio-to-snow.PNG" width="40%" height="40%"/>
</figure>
</p>
<p>Then in the script of your controller, change the <code>Update</code> method as follows</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-code" data-lang="code">void Update()
    {
        if (triggered_left)
        {
            triggered_left = false;
            this.GetComponent&lt;AudioSource&gt;().Play();
        }
    }
</code></pre><p>Then you should hear the sound, when performing the stroke.</p>
<p>During the implementation there was big problem, that only one eye was rendering. I have no idea what caused it, but as I wrote this article, I rebuild the application. Downgrading to Unity 2019.4.15f1 did the trick for me,</p>
<p>The files for this project can be found under this <a href="https://github.com/theofbraune/VR-Ski-Locomotion">github link</a>. There you will also find the .apk file, that you can install on the Oculus Quest via Sidequest.
