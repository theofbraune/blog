      <description>In this post I will evaluate my locomotion technique.
The fact that we have fixed boxes significantly reduces the cybersickness, as it is giving a fixed point. Furthermore moving with the body at all, the head also moves forward. This also reduces cybersickness, as the conflict between the seen and the feeled picture reduces.</description>

      <title>Unity setup</title>

      <description>First I went to the official unity page. This article assumes, that you have not installed unity yet. Thus you need to download the unity hub.
 In this article I am using Windows, but the steps for the other operating systems are not that different. Of course you need to accept the unity licence agreement. Then you will see a window for the install location of the unity hub.  As I understood it, you can consider the unity hub as something, that will load for you all the utils from the big unity machinery (like shaders, libraries&amp;hellip;) that you&amp;rsquo;ll need for a good game.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Ski Locomotion in Virtual Reality.</title>

      <description>In my locomotion project I went for an approach to imitate cross-country-skiing in VR. The overall idea will be, that you have to move your arms from top to down, and this then gives you a push.
[INCLUDE PICTURE]
In the first part of my implementation, I realized, that I can enter the ground. In order to prevent this, I first implemented a very simple locomotion with a joystick, where I take the x-value and associate it to the speed that the player will feel.</description>

      <description>In this post I will describe possibilities of locomotion in virtual reality.
The Alpine Way - Cross Country Skiing Suppose you are in the Alps and there is enough snow to use your cross country skies, you can do your health a favor and do this wonderful sport.
         Image Credits - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaMTbWNVRko    To move forward you have two sticks whitch can help you to move forward, while skating on the snow.</description>

      <description>Who knows whether we are not all the time already in some kind of ultimate display&amp;hellip;.
In 1994 Paul Milgram published with a work, where he introduced the idea of a Reality-Virtuality Continuum. You can think of it in the following way: With the rise of technology, like smartphones or in general some Silicon Valley Hardware device, the line between what is reality and what is virtual becomes more and more unclear.</description>

      <title>Mixed Reality and the Metaverse - A dystopian world?</title>

      <description>In the following I&amp;rsquo;ll describe two fictional scenarios, how mixed reality technology could be abused. Some other inspiration for that can be found here
The &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo;-ensurance Imagine the following scenario. You are trapped in a YouTube loophole. You&amp;rsquo;ve seen all the Gordon Ramsay-Best-Of videos and the ad&amp;rsquo;s you see are all the same for hours. You watch for the fifth time the spot of this weird new and fictional Silicon Valley Company &amp;ldquo;Exosmart&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>If you want to create your own website or webblog, you are often faced with a ton of possible frameworks. Here in this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how you can easily setup your webblog with the static page generator hugo.To get started, you first need to install the Hugo framework. I used on Ubuntu the Snap store for it.
 In the next step I created a new directory, where I created all the necessary files.</description>
